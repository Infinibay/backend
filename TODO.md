- [x] Write comprehensive tests for VMHealthQueueManager
- [ ] Update documentation and .ai directory

## Current Status
‚úÖ Database schema is fully implemented and migrated
‚úÖ VMHealthSnapshot and VMHealthCheckQueue models are ready for use
üîß E2E tests have schema issues but core functionality tests are passing
