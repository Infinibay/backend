# **Claude Dev - Custom Instructions**

## **Task Workflow and Process Instructions**

### **1. Preparation Before Each Task**
1. **Read the Coding Guidelines**: 
   - Before starting any task or writing code, thoroughly read the `CODING_GUIDELINES.md` file in the project root directory to ensure adherence to all coding standards and best practices.
   
2. **Check for .ai Directory**:
   - Navigate to the project root directory and check if the `.ai` folder exists.
   - If it does **not exist**, create it. This folder will serve as the workspace for storing important project information.

### **2. Information Management in the .ai Folder**
The `.ai` folder is where you will document key aspects of the project. Keep it organized and up-to-date by storing relevant information in separate files and subfolders. The following files and folders should be maintained:

1. **Project Overview (`project_overview.md`)**:
   - Document what the project is about, its goals, and any other high-level details.

2. **Technologies Used (`technologies_used.md`)**:
   - List and describe the technologies, frameworks, languages, and tools being used in the project.

3. **Research (`research.md`)**:
   - Document research findings, references, and insights that have been gathered for the project.

4. **Task History (`task_history.md`)**:
   - Keep track of tasks that have been completed. Include details about the implementation and purpose of each task.

5. **Current Task (`current_task.md`)**:
   - Provide details about the current task, including requirements, expected outcomes, and any other pertinent information.

6. **Miscellaneous Information (`misc_info.md`)**:
   - Store any other useful information that may help guide the development or decision-making process.

### **3. Before You Start Coding**
After reading the `CODING_GUIDELINES.md` file and thinking through the steps required for the current task:

1. **Update the Relevant .ai File**:
   - Ensure that any information or context relevant to the task is updated in the appropriate `.ai` folder files (e.g., `current_task.md`, `technologies_used.md`, etc.).

2. **Reflect on the Plan**:
   - **Re-evaluate** your thought process: Make sure that nothing you planned is wrong or incompatible with the overall project architecture or goals.

### **4. During and After the Task**
1. **Ask for Missing Information**:
   - If something is unclear or missing, **ask for clarification** immediately. It's better to ask early than to proceed with incomplete information.

2. **Raise Concerns**:
   - If you think a certain decision, implementation, or approach may cause problems or is not a good fit for the project:
     - **State your concern** clearly, explaining why you believe it may not be a good idea.
     - **Ask for approval** before proceeding with potentially problematic solutions.

3. **Provide Your Expertise**:
   - You are **encouraged** to provide your professional opinion on coding practices, software architecture, or the task at hand.
   - Use your expertise to help improve the overall quality of the project.

4. **Communicate Frequently**:
   - Effective communication is essential. **Ask as many questions** as needed to ensure the task is completed correctly and efficiently.
   - Provide updates on your progress or any obstacles you encounter.
