# Test Suite Fixes Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Status**: Partial Progress  

## Summary

Successfully fixed critical TypeScript compilation errors in key test files following the backend architecture refactoring. The test suite now has improved type safety with no `any` types in the fixed files.

## Files Fixed

### 1. NetworkService.test.ts ✅
**Issues Fixed**:
- `mockResolvedValue` type mismatches with libvirt-node return types
- Fixed by using `mockImplementation` with proper Promise return types
- All mock return values now properly typed

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
mockConnection.listAllNetworks.mockResolvedValue([])

// After  
mockConnection.listAllNetworks.mockImplementation(
  () => Promise.resolve([]) as Promise<Network[]>
)
```

### 2. auth.test.ts ✅
**Issues Fixed**:
- Removed all 21 `any` types
- Created proper type interfaces for AuthContext and DecodedToken
- Replaced direct authChecker calls with testAuthChecker wrapper
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

**Key Changes**:
- Added AuthContext and DecodedToken interfaces
- Created testAuthChecker function for testing
- Replaced all `any` types with proper types

## Test Suite Status

**Before Fixes**:
- Test Suites: 9 failed, 10 passed, 19 total
- Multiple TypeScript compilation errors preventing tests from running

**After Fixes**:
- Test Suites: 8 failed, 11 passed, 19 total
- NetworkService.test.ts now passing ✅
- auth.test.ts now compiles and runs (2 test failures, not TypeScript errors)

## Remaining Issues

Still have TypeScript errors in:
- machine.test.ts
- machine-template.test.ts
- security.test.ts
- machine-lifecycle.test.ts
- graphql-api.test.ts
- MachineLifecycleService.test.ts
- VirtioSocketWatcherService.test.ts

These files have issues with:
- Missing resolver methods
- Mock return value type mismatches
- Missing arguments in resolver calls

## Recommendations

1. Continue fixing remaining test files with similar patterns
2. Focus on proper typing for mocks and test helpers
3. Consider creating centralized test utilities for common mock patterns
4. Update resolver tests to match actual resolver signatures

## Technical Debt

- Tests were not updated when refactoring was done
- Need better type safety in test utilities
- Consider using more robust mocking libraries with better TypeScript support

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining TypeScript errors in test files
2. Update resolver tests to match new service patterns
3. Create proper test helpers for new services (DataLoaderService, BackgroundTaskService, etc.)
4. Add tests for new monitoring and error handling features
